# LionAPI 
is my core project and is required by most of my plugins.<br>
It provides a basic challenge and team API that can be used in plugins that require
- a timer (and additional functions like ending the challenge when a player or the dragon dies)
- teams / backpacks 
- additional worlds and tools like cloning and resetting worlds
- multi server setups (server communication)
- velocity connections 
- special GUIs
- and more
<br>
